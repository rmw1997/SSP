# Student Service Program

## Project Overview

A **Student Services Program (SSP)** serves students to predict semester and cumulative GPA,

- Number of hours of all courses taken in all previous semesters (e.g. 22 hours)
- Number of courses taken in the current semester
- Courses’ names (Optional), credit hours, and expected grade

Then the student would click **“Calculate”** to show the expected semester and cumulative GPA.




### Absence Calculator
